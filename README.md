# Bieb: the personal book collection website

Website project based on ASP.NET MVC for managing and displaying your personal book collection on the web.

----

***IMPORTANT NOTE: Development on this project has been discontinued as of December 2015.***

See [this blogpost](http://blog.jeroenheijmans.nl/2015/12/13/finishing-bieb/) for more information.

Note that this is a work in progress for a personal website (see primary goal, below), that also serves as an experimentation sandbox (see secondary goals, below). This code is for _fun_, and is certainly not guaranteed to be _industrial strength_. If you enjoy this code, want to add something, or have questions: leave a message!

*Note on releases*: we are still working towards the first www-ready release. This means that although the source is already available for anyone, there are also some important bits still missing, such as a tutorial on how to get up and running. If you are reading this and interested in getting up and running pre-release: drop us a note!

## Preview

Here's what it's supposed to look like, currently:

## Primary Objective

- Creating an ASP.NET MVC website, which will showcase all the books in a personal library.

## Secondary Objectives

- Finding out more about Codeplex
- Experimentation sandbox for MSSQL, ASP.NET MVC, NHibernate, Ninject, html5, css3, jQuery, and Modernizr
- Experimentation sandbox for trying out competing and additional frameworks

## Nice Side Effects

* Having this website project available for anyone who's interested
* Real-life events such as BBQ's and drinks to "discuss the project"
